Great — thanks for the screenshot! Since your project currently includes:

- `app.py` (the Streamlit app)
- `brain_tumor_model.h5` (the trained model)
- `requirements.txt`

I'll now create an **updated `README.md`** file with:

- Project description
- Setup instructions
- Deployment instructions (with a placeholder for your Streamlit share link)
- Info about the `.h5` model being large
- Clean formatting

---

### ✅ Final `README.md`

```markdown
# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection Model

A deep learning project for detecting brain tumors from brain scan images using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), deployed via a user-friendly Streamlit web app.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maliph-Guye/brain_tumor_detection_model.git
   cd brain_tumor_detection_model
````

2. **(Optional but Recommended) Create Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application Locally**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🌐 Deployment

You can deploy the app on platforms like:

- [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) ✅
- Hugging Face Spaces (Gradio or Streamlit)
- Render or Heroku (with a small server setup)

### 🔗 Live App Link

> 📌 **Streamlit Deployment (Replace below with your actual link once deployed):**
> 🌍 [https://your-username.streamlit.app](https://your-username.streamlit.app)

## ⚠️ Notes

- The model file (`brain_tumor_model.h5`) is **~51 MB**, which exceeds GitHub's soft file limit.

  - For collaboration or future improvements, consider using [Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

- Ensure you have at least **1.5GB free space** when installing dependencies like TensorFlow.
